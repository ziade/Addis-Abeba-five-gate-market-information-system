Free Mobile SMS API
============
This package allow you to send SMS to your Free Mobile phone for monitoring.

## Requirements

1. You need an activated Free Mobile phone number
2. The option "Notifications par SMS" must be activated on the [account settings page](https://mobile.free.fr/moncompte/index.php?page=options)

## Dependencies
- [ssl-root-cas] (https://www.npmjs.org/package/ssl-root-cas)

**Currently the Free's server haven't public key on his certificate, so the SSL certificate couldn't be validated and trusted! I have reported this issue the Oct 7th 2014 to their staff. ssl-root-cas is implemented and functional for the day when they will deploy a patch for this vulnerability. Meanwhile the `rejectUnauthorized` option should remain disabled for the module to work properly :(**
